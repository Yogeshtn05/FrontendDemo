# MERN Stack project for User Management

The link to the hosted website is : https://frontend-demo-livid.vercel.app/

In this project I developed a MERN Stack Webpage for collecting the information about users.
The users can edit their information also.

For this application I used MongoDB database for storing the records of the users.
Using API interfacing the backend will store the records in the MongoDB database.

The Backend is hosted at Render and this will increase the security of the users inofrmation.

The Frontend is hosted at vercel and the API from Render is interfaced here for updating and retrieving the records.
